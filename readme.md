# Disney Secure Delivery

**Disney Secure Delivery** is a production-ready, containerised application deployed securely on AWS.

The base application was cloned from [hollyabrams/capstone-project-1](https://github.com/hollyabrams/capstone-project-1) and re-engineered to run as a **cloud-native service** using Docker, ECS Fargate, and Terraform. It leverages **CI/CD automation, strong security controls, and scalable AWS infrastructure**.

The backend uses **Amazon DynamoDB** for persistence. The application is fronted by an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, protected with **AWS WAF**, and routed via **Route53**. Infrastructure is managed with **Terraform modules**, and all deployments run through **GitHub Actions workflows** with OIDC authentication.

## Architecture at a Glance
*(Pop your architecture diagram here)*

- **Flask backend** containerised via Docker
- **AWS ECS (Fargate)** handling deployment
- **ALB** with redirect from HTTP → secure HTTPS (via ACM certificate)
- **WAF** shields the app with AWS-managed rules
- Data persists in **DynamoDB**
- DNS handled via **Route 53**
- Access logs land in **S3**, metrics in **CloudWatch**
- All wired up using modular Terraform for clean reusability

---

## Highlights

- **Dockerised** with a slim Python 3.12 base
- Infrastructure defined via Terraform modules—flexible, reusable
- Secure CI/CD using **GitHub Actions + OIDC**, no long-lived credentials
- Key AWS components: ALB, WAF, VPC, DynamoDB, Route53, IAM roles, CloudWatch logs & metrics
- Terraform plan reveals the creation of: VPC, public subnets, Internet Gateway, ALB (with HTTP redirect), HTTPS listener, target group, WAF ACL, ECS service & task definition, Route 53 record, S3 bucket (ALB logs), IAM roles, and security groups tagged cleanly
